### 🚀 About Me
I'm an aspiring **Cloud and DevOps Engineer** currently diving deep into:
- 🧠 AWS Cloud (Networking, EC2, IAM, CloudFormation)
- 🔧 DevOps Tools (Terraform, Docker, GitHub Actions)
- 🛠️ Scripting (Bash, Python)
 
I believe in **continuous learning**, **automating everything**, and **building scalable solutions**. I have some backround in IT support and operations, where I gained some valuable skills in configuring and troubleshooting computer and network systems.
